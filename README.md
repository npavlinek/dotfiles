## About

This is a repository for all of my personal configuration files.

## Installation

    ./install.sh

WARNING: If running under MSYS2, make sure to set the `MSYS` environment variable to `winsymlinks:nativestrict`, otherwise symbolic links are going to be "emulated" by just copying files.

## License

I find it weird to apply copyright to configuration files, so all my configuration is licensed with the Zero Clause BSD License, a public domain equivalent license.
See the `LICENSE` file for more details.
